In this character playbook for Dungeon World, you will find a way to experience the adventures of a Hollow Knight, an armor endowed with a spirit, blocked in this world for centuries and abandoned by its Divine Creator. Use Moves specific to this playbook, which borrows from others such as the Paladin, the Wayfarer or the Defender. Answer questions provided to help you integrate this type of character into a Session Zero. And discover the Design Notes that will help you understand the choices I've made.

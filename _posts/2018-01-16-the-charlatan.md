excerpt: Most of these rubes wouldn't know a real wizard if one came along and turned them into a duck. So, I come through a town, put on a little show, make a few  coins. Everybody wins. I leave with full pockets, and they get a story to tell for the rest of their lives about their brush with the mystic. As a matter of fact, I'd say they get the better end of this whole deal. Now if you'll excuse me, it seems the villagers want to present me with some honorary pitchforks.

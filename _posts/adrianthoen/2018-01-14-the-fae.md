description: "The Fae is a playbook designed for use with Dungeon World and Inverse World. As The Fae, you will be tricking your enemies with illusions, pranks, and tricks, blessing some with wishes, damning others with curses, and causing no end of mischief and trouble. But beware, every Fae has rules they must abide, and weaknesses that can cause them trouble. You will have to walk a fine line between causing trouble and solving it!""
